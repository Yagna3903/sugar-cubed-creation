# Placeholder for Square's Apple Pay domain verification file

# Replace the contents of this file with the exact text Square provides

# when you enable Apple Pay for your application and register a domain.

#

# Square will provide a file named

# apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association

# with a specific payload. Place that payload (exact bytes) in this file.

#

# Example steps:

# 1. In Square Developer Dashboard → Apple Pay (or Web Payments) enable Apple Pay.

# 2. Square gives you the exact file content. Copy it and overwrite this file.

# 3. Visit https://<your-domain>/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association

# to confirm it's served.

# 4. Tell Square to verify the domain (there's an option in the dashboard).

#

# Note: For local testing, expose your dev server via ngrok and add the ngrok URL

# to Square's verified domains. The file must be accessible at:

# https://<ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association
